# Tip Calculator App

This is a simple Android app created during my BSc to help users calculate tips based on the total amount of their bill. Users can enter the total amount, choose a tip percentage, and the app will calculate both the tip and the total cost. It's designed to be straightforward and easy to use, providing a quick solution for calculating tips in various situations. The app was built using Android Studio, Java, and XML, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.
